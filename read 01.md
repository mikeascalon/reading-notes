What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.

Why do we use Markdown?
Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application.
