## Operators and Loops

1.What is an expression in JavaScript?

-an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate.

2.Why would we use a loop in our code?

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.

3.When does a for loop stop executing?

-When the condition expression is evaluated. If the value of condition is true, the loop statements execute. Otherwise, the for loop terminates.
a for loop stops executing when the loop condition evaluates to false.

4.How many times will a while loop execute?

-The number of times a while loop will execute depends on the condition specified in the loop. The loop will keep executing its code block as long as the condition remains true. When the condition evaluates to false, the loop will stop executing. Therefore, the exact number of iterations a while loop will go through depends on the logic within the loop and how the condition is set.
