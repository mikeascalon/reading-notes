## What is HTML and why do we use it?

HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way.

## What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?

1.The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.

2.The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.

3.The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.

## What is it called when you give an element extra information?

Attribute

## What is a semantic element?

Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code- "what purpose or role does that HTML element have"
