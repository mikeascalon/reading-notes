# Reading Notes

## Troubleshooting JavaScript

1.Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

* Syntac error -These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through â€” you will usually be provided with some error messages too

* Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results.

2.List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

* there alot of times it was a spelling, a space, or a code is not on the right place. First I try to find the error with in the VS code. Next I would look at the brower and check the console see if I any error. next it still I can't find the error it will be chat gpt. Lastly it will be the TA's.

3.How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

* I think it very helpfull as everyday we encounter errors. Not getting frustrated , walking out and coming to look at the code or getting somebody check your code.

## The JavaScript Debugger

1.How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

* It's like a  code reader for the car. It will point to the bug your having that and not you trying to look for a very small error that you have been looking at for the pass few hours.

2.Define what a breakpoint is.

* It is a designated point or location in the source code of a computer program where the execution of the program can be temporarily halted, allowing developers to inspect and manipulate the program's state at that specific moment

3.What is the call stack?

* It used to keep track of the execution of functions or subroutines in a computer program
