## Troubleshooting JavaScript

1.Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

* Syntac error -These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through â€” you will usually be provided with some error messages too

* Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results.

2.List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

there alot of times it was a spelling, a space, or a code is not on the right place. First I try to find the error with in the VS code. Next I would look at the brower and check the console see if I any error. next it still I can't find the error it will be chat gpt. Lastly it will be the TA's.

3.How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

I think it very helpfull as everyday we encounter errors. Not getting frustrated , walking out and coming to look at the code or getting somebody check your code.
