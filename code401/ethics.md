I think this is common sense how the AI will decides on who dies or lives is on how it’s program. AI follows its programming and the data it's been given. It doesn't think like humans do; instead, it sticks to rules and patterns it's learned from the information it's been taught. Even though AI can seem smart, it doesn't have common sense like people do. It's important to make sure AI is fair and transparent when it makes these big decisions. Sometimes, AI can pick up biases from the data it learns from, which isn't good. That's why it's essential for experts in different fields to work together to make sure AI behaves ethically and treats everyone fairly.
