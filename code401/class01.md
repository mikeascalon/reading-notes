# Reading Notes

## Class 1

1.In the context of the reading “Pain and Suffering,” describe the main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python and suggest at least two strategies for overcoming these obstacles.

* First, you need to apply your growth mindset. Learning requires a price, and that price is time. We have to sacrifice and allocate time to whatever you want to learn. Second, it is always challenging to learn new things. If everything is easy, everybody can learn it.

2.After reading “Beginners Guide to Big O,” explain the concept of time complexity and space complexity.

* Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete, as a function of the size of its input. Space complexity is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses, again as a function of the size of its input. Similar to time complexity, space complexity also describes the worst-case scenario. It indicates how the memory requirements of an algorithm scale with the input size.


Based on the “Names and Values in Python” reading, explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python.

* Mutable (Changeable): Like a whiteboard where you can write, erase, and modify information. Examples in Python are lists, dictionaries, and sets.

* Immutable (Unchangeable): Like a sealed letter where the content is fixed. Examples in Python are integers, floats, strings, and tuples.
