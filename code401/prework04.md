# Reading Notes Prework

What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

* Different data structures excel in different types of operations (e.g., insertion, deletion, search), and choosing the right one can significantly impact the performance of your algorithm. 

How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

* Always define a base case in your recursive function. The base case is the condition under which the function stops calling itself and returns a result. Without a base case, the recursion would continue indefinitely.
