# The Command Line Basics

## What is it?
- The command line, or terminal, is a text-based interface to interact with the computer's operating system.
- Users enter commands in text form.
- The system interprets and executes these commands, providing output.

## How does it work?
- On Linux: Open Terminal.
- On Windows: Use Command Prompt or Git Bash.

## How to access it?
- `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
- `ls`: List files and directories in the current directory.
- `cd`: Change directory. (e.g., `cd Documents`)
- `.` and `..`: `.` refers to the current directory, `..` refers to the parent directory.

# More About Files

## File Types
- Regular files, directories, symbolic links, etc.

## Hidden Files
- Start with a dot (e.g., `.env`).
- Display with `ls -a`.

## File Permissions
- Display with `ls -l`.
- Read, write, and execute permissions for owner, group, and others.

# Manual Pages

- `man`: Access manual pages for commands. (e.g., `man ls`)
- Navigating Manual Pages: Use arrow keys to scroll, press `q` to exit.

# File Manipulation

## Creating Files and Directories
- `touch filename`: Create an empty file.
- `mkdir directoryname`: Create a new directory.

## Removing Files and Directories
- `rm filename`: Remove a file.
- `rmdir directoryname`: Remove an empty directory.
- `rm -r directoryname`: Remove a directory and its contents.

## Renaming and Moving
- `mv oldname newname`: Rename a file or directory.
- `mv source destination`: Move a file or directory.

## Copying
- `cp source destination`: Copy a file or directory.
