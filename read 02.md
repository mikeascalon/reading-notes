## What are four important features to look for in a text editor?
  - code completion 
  - syntax highlighting 
  - a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue) 
  - the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.

## What do the following commands do?
* **pwd** - It prints the path of the working directory, starting from the root.
  
* **ls** - displays a list of the names of all files in the current working directory
  
* **cd** - command that changes the directory you are in when working in the terminal
  
* **mkdir** - command that allows the user to create directories
  
* **touch** - To create a new empty file 

## Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

* **cd projects** - change directory into projects folder
* **mkdir new-project** - make a new directory name new-projects under the projects directory.
* **touch new-project/newfile.md**  - make a new file named newfile.md in the new-project directory
* **cd ..** - you are leaving the directory and going 1 level up
* **ls projects/new-project** - list of files inside the new folder named new-projects that is under the directory of projects
